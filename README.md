# Mastermind
This is my attempt at creating the board game Mastermind in Java using the console interface.

Currently the computer selects a 4 colour code made up of up to 6 different colours and offers the player the chance to guess the code using the command line.

Feedback is given as to ho many of the colours are correct and in the right place, and how many are correct and in the wrong place.
